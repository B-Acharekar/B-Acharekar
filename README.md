# Hi, I'm Bhushan Acharekar (@B-Acharekar)

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **fullstack developer** passionate about building scalable, modern web and mobile applications.
My strength lies in creating clean UIs, powerful backend systems, and seamless user experiences — all while writing efficient, maintainable code.

I’ve worked across the stack, including foundational knowledge of **Cloud**, **DevOps**, and **Operating Systems**, but my core strength is fullstack application development — especially with **React**, **Next.js**, and **MongoDB**.

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Focusing On

* ✅ **Mastering Fullstack** – Advanced development using **React**, **Next.js**, **Firebase**, and **MongoDB**
* ⚙️ **DevOps & Cloud Foundations** – Deployments on **AWS**, Docker basics, and CI/CD workflows
* 📱 **Cross-Platform Development** – Mostly using **React Native**, with occasional use of **Flutter**
* 🧠 **Problem Solving** – Consistently solving **C++ DSA problems** on **LeetCode**
